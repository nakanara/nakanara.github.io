### Chapter 1

> yo George  
never `thought` I'd say this, but I think it stinks that you won't be going to our school anymore, now I'll be the only one in class H/A telling jokes, and my jokes always sounded better next to yours.  
At least at your new school, you can be the funny guy.  
your pal, Kadeem

George lay on his bed and stared[stare 응시] at Kadeem's page in the Good-bye, George book the kids at his old school had made for him. But Kadeem's page was the one that made George the saddest and the maddest. Sad because now he had no friends to tell jokes to. And made because Kadeem moad it sound like his jokes were funnier than George's And that wasn't ture. No way!

George reread what Kevin, his best friend, had written. At least Kevin used to be George's best friend. Could you stay best friends with someone far away?

> George,  
I was just thinking about the time in thired grade when you put the fake spider on Mrs.Derkman's chair in the cafeteria. I never heard anyone scream so Loud. I laughed so hard, milk came out of my nose.  
Boy, will I miss you, Kevin  
P.S Here's a photo so you don't forget what I look Like.

George started to laugh, No one was more `afraid[əˈfrād]` of bugs that `mean[mēn]` Mrs.Jerkman. (That was what George had always called tis strict third-grade teacher-at least behind her back.) Freaking her out was always fun. 

George turned the page in his book. The next note was from Suzanne Lock.

> George,  
Good-bye. Suzanne

Even seeing that `cheered[CHir]` George up. Suzanne hadn't wanted to write anything. Her teacher had made her do it. Not that George `blamed[blām]` Suzanne. It wasn't like they'd ever been friends or anyting.

But the note on the page next to Suzanne's was from one of George's really good friends.

> Dear George,  
I'm really going to miss you. You made me laugh-a lot. I think you are really `brave[brāv]`. I'd be `scared[skerd]` to move to a new town. But you don't `seem[sēm]` scared at all. I know you will have a lot of friends in Beaver Brook.  
Your friend,  
Katie Kazoo  
PS-Thanks for the way-cool nickname

George `thought[THôt]` Katie's last name, Carew, sounded like a kazoo. And the nickname had `stuck`.
Katie was a really good friend. And she was pretty smart. But she was wrong about George. He was scared to be living in a new town and starting in anew school today.

George had a lot of `practice[praktəs]` being the new kid. His dad was in the army and his family moved `around[əˈround]` a lot. But it was never easy. After spending two whole years in Cherrydale, he had `almost[ˈôlˌmōst]` started feeling like an "old" kid. Then-BAM-here he was in Beaver Brook.

"George! It's 0-800 hours. `Gotta[ˈɡädə]` get a move on! Front and center!"
  His dad's deep voice `echoed[ˈekō` `through[THro͞o]` the halls of their new house. It was a lot bigger that their old house. Even with all their `furniture[ˈfərniCHər]`, it `felt[felt]` empyt. In fact, the long `upstairs[əpˈsterz]` hallway would be great for skateboarding-except his mom never let him skateboard in the house.
